    "energyml.prodml2_2.TransmissibilityReductionFactorOfLinearFront": "The transmissibility reduction factor of a fault in a Linear Composite model where the boundary of the inner and outer zones is a leaky fault. If T is the complete transmissibility which would be computed without any fault between point A and point B (T is a function of permeability, etc), then Tf = T * leakage. Therefore: leakage = 1 implies that the fault is not a barrier to flow at all, leakage = 0 implies that the fault is sealing (no transmissibility anymore at all between points A and B).",
