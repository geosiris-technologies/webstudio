Otherwise, the interpolant in the first or last interval is used as an extrapolating function.\n\nSpecial Cases:\n(1) Natural cubic splines with only two control points reduce to linear interpolation.\n(2) If required but not defined, tangent vectors at a spline knot are calculated from the control point data using a quadratic fit to the control point and the two adjacent control points (if internal) or, if at an edge, by a vanishing second derivative. This calculation reduces locally to a natural spline.\n(3) If not expected but provided, then extraneous information is to be ignored, e.g., tangent vectors for linear splines.\n\nVertical:\n(1) Control points are (X,Y,-).\n(2) Parameter values are interpreted as depth => (X,Y,Z), where the depth to Z conversion depends on the vertical CRS direction.\n\nPiecewise Linear:\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) Piecewise interpolation in (X,Y,Z) as a linear function of P.\n\nNatural Cubic:\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) First and second derivatives at each knot are inferred from a quadratic fit to the two adjacent control points, if internal, or, if external knots, by specifying a vanishing second derivative.\n(3) Interpolating basis functions are obtained by specifying values and second derivatives at the knots.\n\nCubic and Minimum-Curvature.\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) Tangent vectors are (P,TX,TY,TZ). Tangent vectors are defined as the derivative of position with respect to the parameter.

This differs from the unconstrained \"drilling\" algorithm in which the knot locations are not independent but for which the parameter must be arc length.\n\nZ Linear Cubic:\n(1) (X,Y) follow a natural cubic spline and Z follows a linear spline.\n(2) Parametric values cannot be freely chosen but are instead defined to take the values of 0,,,.N for a line with N intervals, N+1 control points.\n(3) On export, to go from Z to P, the RESQML \"software writer\" first needs to determine the interval and then uses linearity in Z to determine P. For the control points, the P values are 0...N and for values of Z, other than the control points, intermediate values of P arise.\n(4) On import, a RESQML \"software reader\" converts from P to Z using piecewise linear interpolation, and from P to X and Y using natural cubic spline interpolation. Other than the differing treatment of Z from X and Y, these are completely generic interpolation algorithms.\n(5) The use of P instead of Z for interpolation allows support for over-turned reservoir structures and removes any apparent discontinuities in parametric derivatives at the spline knots.",

The use of cell-face-pairs is more complete than single cell-faces, which are missing a corresponding cell face entry, and only provide an incomplete representation of the topology of a fault.\n\nUnlike what is sometimes the case in reservoir simulation software, RESQML does not distinguish between standard and non-standard connections. \nWithin RESQML if a grid connection corresponds to a \"nearest neighbor\" as defined by the cell indices, then it is never additive to the implicit nearest neighbor connection.\n\nBUSINESS RULE: A single cell-face-pair should not appear within more than a single grid connection set.

The geometry of a polyline must be a 1D array of points.\n\nA simple polygonal chain is one in which only consecutive (or the first and the last) segments intersect and only at their endpoints.\n\nA closed polygonal chain (isClosed=True) is one in which the first vertex coincides with the last one, or the first and the last vertices are connected by a line segment.
