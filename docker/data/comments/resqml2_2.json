    "energyml.resqml2_2.ViewerKind": "Standardized kinds of viewers.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.ViewerKindExt": "Allows you to use custom viewer kinds in addition to the ViewerKind enumeration.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.VoidageGroupInterpretation": "A group of ReservoirSegments which are hydraulically connected and are generally developed as a single reservoir.\n\nMembership in this organization can change over time (geologic and over the life of a field or interpretation activity) and is an interpretation.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.VolumeRegion": "The volume within a shell.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.VolumeShell": "The shell or envelope of a geologic unit. It is a collection of macro faces. Each macro face is defined by a triplet of values, each value being at the same index in the three arrays contained in this class.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WellboreFeature": "May refer to one of these: \nwellbore. A unique, oriented path from the bottom of a drilled borehole to the surface of the earth. The path must not overlap or cross itself.\n\nborehole. A hole excavated in the earth as a result of drilling or boring operations. The borehole may represent the hole of an entire wellbore (when no sidetracks are present), or a sidetrack extension. A borehole extends from an originating point (the surface location for the initial borehole or kickoff point for sidetracks) to a terminating (bottomhole) point.\n\nsidetrack. A borehole that originates in another borehole as opposed to originating at the surface.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WellboreFrameRepresentation": "Representation of a wellbore that is organized along a wellbore trajectory by its MD values. RESQML uses MD values to associate properties on points and to organize association of properties on intervals between MD points. \n\nFor this particular representation a WITSML v2 Wellbore is considered as a RESQML Technical Feature, meaning that the WITSML v2 Wellbore can be used as the represented data object for this representation.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WellboreInterpretation": "Contains the data describing an opinion of a borehole. This interpretation is relative to one particular well trajectory. ",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WellboreTrajectoryParentIntersection": "For a wellbore trajectory in a multi-lateral well, indicates the MD of the kickoff point where the trajectory begins and the corresponding MD of the parent trajectory. ",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WellboreTrajectoryRepresentation": "Representation of a wellbore trajectory.\n\nFor this particular representation a WITSML v2 Wellbore is considered as a RESQML Technical Feature, meaning that the WITSML v2 Wellbore can be used as the represented data object for this representation.",
    "energyml.resqml2_2.WitsmlWellWellbore": "Reference to the WITSML wellbore that this wellbore feature is based on. "
