This calculation reduces locally to a natural spline.\n(3) If not expected but provided, then extraneous information is to be ignored, e.g., tangent vectors for linear splines.\n\nVertical:\n(1) Control points are (X,Y,-).\n(2) Parameter values are interpreted as depth => (X,Y,Z), where the depth to Z conversion depends on the vertical CRS direction.\n\nPiecewise Linear:\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) Piecewise interpolation in (X,Y,Z) as a linear function of P.\n\nNatural Cubic:\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) First and second derivatives at each knot are inferred from a quadratic fit to the two adjacent control points, if internal, or, if external knots, by specifying a vanishing second derivative.\n\nTangential Cubic and Minimum-Curvature.\n(1) Control points are (P,X,Y,Z).\n(2) Tangent vectors are (P,TX,TY,TZ).

For the control points, the P values are 0...N and for values of Z, other than the control points, non-integral values of P arise.\n(4) On import, a RESQML \"software reader\" converts from P to Z using piecewise linear interpolation, and from P to X and Y using natural cubic spline interpolation.
