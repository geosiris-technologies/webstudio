    "energyml.witsml2_0.Wellbore": "Used to capture the general information about a wellbore. This information is sometimes called a \"wellbore header\". A wellbore represents the path from surface to a unique bottomhole location. The wellbore object is uniquely identified within the context of one well object.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreCompletion": "The transferrable class of the WellboreCompletion object. Each individual wellbore completion data object represents a completion (i.e., open to flow) interval along a wellbore. Meaning \"this section of wellbore is open to flow\".",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreFluidLocation": "Specified the location where cement job fluid can be found. ",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreGeology": "The transferrable class of the WellboreGeology object.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreGeometry": "Used to capture information about the configuration of the permanently installed components in a wellbore. This object is uniquely identified within the context of one wellbore object.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreGeometrySection": "Wellbore Geometry Component Schema. Defines the \"fixed\" components in a wellbore. It does not define the \"transient\" drilling strings or the \"hanging\" production components.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreMarker": "Used to capture information about a geologic formation that was encountered in a wellbore. This object is uniquely identified within the context of one wellbore object.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreMarkerSet": "A collection of wellbore markers.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreShape": "Specifies values to represent the classification of a wellbore based on its shape. The source of the values and the descriptions is the POSC V2.2 \"facility class\" standard instance values in classification system \"POSC wellbore trajectory shape\".",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WellboreType": "Specifies the values for the classification of a wellbore with respect to its parent well/wellbore.",
    "energyml.witsml2_0.WobStatistics": "Measurement of average weight on bit and channel from which the data was calculated."
